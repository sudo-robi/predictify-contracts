//! FeeCalculator property-based tests
//!
//! These tests use `proptest` to verify that `FeeCalculator::calculate_platform_fee`
//! and `FeeCalculator::calculate_fee_breakdown` never charge more than the
//! configured basis-point rate, always round down (floor), and always
//! reconcile exactly with `total_staked`.
//!
//! ## Invariants covered
//! 1. `fee <= total_staked` for every generated stake.
//! 2. `fee` never exceeds the configured bps rate applied to `total_staked`
//!    (i.e. `fee * 10_000 <= total_staked * PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENTAGE`).
//! 3. Rounding is strictly floor: `fee` is the largest integer satisfying (2).
//! 4. `platform_fee + user_payout_amount == total_staked` (breakdown reconciles).
//! 5. Fee is monotonically non-decreasing as `total_staked` increases.
//!
//! ## Non-goals
//! - Dynamic/activity-adjusted fees (`calculate_dynamic_fee`) — covered separately.
//! - Fee collection/storage side effects — covered by `fee_idempotency_tests.rs`.
