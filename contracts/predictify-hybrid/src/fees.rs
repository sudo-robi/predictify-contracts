// ===== FEE TYPES =====

/// Comprehensive fee configuration structure for market operations.
///
/// This structure defines all fee-related parameters that govern how fees are
/// calculated, collected, and managed across the Predictify Hybrid platform.
/// It provides flexible configuration for different market types and economic models.
///
/// # Fee Structure
///
/// The fee system supports multiple fee types:
/// - **Platform Fees**: Percentage-based fees on market stakes
/// - **Creation Fees**: Fixed fees for creating new markets
/// - **Collection Thresholds**: Minimum amounts before fee collection
/// - **Fee Limits**: Minimum and maximum fee boundaries
///
/// # Example Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// # use soroban_sdk::Env;
/// # use predictify_hybrid::fees::FeeConfig;
/// # let env = Env::default();
///
/// // Standard fee configuration
/// let config = FeeConfig {
///     platform_fee_percentage: 200, // 2.00% (basis points)
///     creation_fee: 10_000_000, // 1.0 XLM
///     min_fee_amount: 1_000_000, // 0.1 XLM minimum
///     max_fee_amount: 1_000_000_000, // 100 XLM maximum
///     collection_threshold: 100_000_000, // 10 XLM threshold
///     fees_enabled: true,
/// };
///
/// // Calculate platform fee for 50 XLM stake
/// let stake_amount = 500_000_000; // 50 XLM
/// let platform_fee = (stake_amount * config.platform_fee_percentage) / 10_000;
/// println!("Platform fee: {} XLM", platform_fee / 10_000_000);
///
/// // Check if fees are collectible
/// if config.fees_enabled && stake_amount >= config.collection_threshold {
///     println!("Fees can be collected");
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Configuration Parameters
///
/// - **platform_fee_percentage**: Fee percentage in basis points (100 = 1%)
/// - **creation_fee**: Fixed fee for creating new markets (in stroops)
/// - **min_fee_amount**: Minimum fee that can be charged (prevents dust)
/// - **max_fee_amount**: Maximum fee that can be charged (prevents abuse)
/// - **collection_threshold**: Minimum total stakes before fees can be collected
/// - **fees_enabled**: Global fee system enable/disable flag
///
/// # Economic Model
///
/// Fee configuration supports platform sustainability:
/// - **Revenue Generation**: Platform fees support ongoing operations
/// - **Spam Prevention**: Creation fees prevent market spam
/// - **Fair Pricing**: Configurable limits ensure reasonable fee levels
/// - **Flexible Economics**: Adjustable parameters for different market conditions

///
/// # Fee Operations
///
/// The system supports multiple fee types:
/// - **Platform Fees**: Percentage-based fees on market stakes
/// - **Creation Fees**: Fixed fees for creating new markets
/// - **Collection Operations**: Automated fee collection from resolved markets
/// - **Configuration Updates**: Dynamic fee parameter adjustments
