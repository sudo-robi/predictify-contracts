// ===== EVENT TYPES =====

/// Event emitted when a new prediction market is successfully created.
///
/// This event provides comprehensive information about newly created markets,
/// including market parameters, outcomes, administrative details, and timing.
/// Essential for tracking market creation activity and building market indices.
///
/// # Event Data
///
/// Contains all critical market creation parameters:
/// - Market identification and question details
/// - Available outcomes for prediction
/// - Administrative and timing information
/// - Creation timestamp for chronological ordering
///
/// # Example Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// # use soroban_sdk::{Env, Address, Symbol, String, Vec};

/// # let env = Env::default();
/// # let admin = Address::generate(&env);
///
/// // Market creation event data
/// let event = MarketCreatedEvent {
///     market_id: Symbol::new(&env, "btc_50k_2024"),
///     question: String::from_str(&env, "Will Bitcoin reach $50,000 by end of 2024?"),
///     outcomes: vec![
