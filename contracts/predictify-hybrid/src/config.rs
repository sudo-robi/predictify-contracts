/// Configuration management system for Predictify Hybrid contract
///
/// This module provides a comprehensive configuration system with:
/// - Centralized constants and configuration values
/// - Environment-specific configuration support
/// - Configuration validation and helper functions
/// - Configuration documentation and testing utilities
/// - Modular configuration system for easier maintenance

// ===== CORE MARKET CONSTANTS =====
//
// RATIONALE: Market structure limits ensure:
//   1. Contract performance - bounded iteration over outcomes
//   2. User experience - meaningful markets without clutter
//   3. Storage efficiency - predictable state size
//
// SAFE RANGES: Derived from:
//   - Soroban storage cost analysis
//   - UI/UX best practices for prediction markets
//   - Competitive analysis (Polymarket, Augur limits)
//   - Security review of DoS vectors
//
// THREAT MODEL: Market creation is open but fee-gated. Admins cannot
//   bypass duration/outcome limits. Excessive creation is limited by
//   creation fees and per-creator active event caps.
//
// INVARIANTS PROVEN:
//   - Market duration is always within [MIN_MARKET_DURATION_DAYS, MAX_MARKET_DURATION_DAYS]
//   - Outcome count is always within [MIN_MARKET_OUTCOMES, MAX_MARKET_OUTCOMES]
//   - Question/outcome lengths are bounded by documented maxima
//
// EXPLICIT NON-GOALS:
//   - These limits do not prevent market manipulation
//   - Duration limits do not guarantee oracle availability

/// Percentage denominator for calculations (100%)
///
/// Rationale: Used as denominator for fee percentage calculations.

// ===== FEE CONSTANTS =====
//
// RATIONALE: Fees serve multiple purposes:
//   1. Platform sustainability - cover operational costs (oracle feeds, infrastructure)
//   2. Spam prevention - creation costs deter low-quality market submissions
//   3. Economic alignment - skin in the game ensures serious participants
//
// SAFE RANGES: These bounds are derived from:
//   - Competitive analysis with other prediction markets (0.5-10% platform fees)
//   - Stellar network transaction cost analysis (dust prevention)
//   - Economic modeling for platform sustainability
//   - Security review to prevent fee manipulation attacks
//
// THREAT MODEL: Fee configuration is admin-protected. Unauthorized fee changes
//   could drain user funds or enable griefing. The max fee cap prevents runaway
//   fees even if admin is compromised.
//
// INVARIANTS PROVEN:
//   - creation_fee is always within [min_fee_amount, max_fee_amount]
//   - platform_fee_percentage is always within [MIN_PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENTAGE, MAX_PLATFORM_FEE_PERCENTAGE]
//   - min_fee_amount < max_fee_amount (enforced by validation)
//
// EXPLICIT NON-GOALS:
//   - Fee changes do not affect already-created markets
//   - Fee configuration does not handle token price volatility

/// Default platform fee percentage (2%)
///
/// Rationale: 2% strikes balance between sustainability (competitive with
/// Polymarket's ~1-2%) and user accessibility. Low enough to encourage
/// participation, high enough to sustain operations.
///
/// Safe range: 0-10%. Below 1% may not cover operational costs at low volume.
/// Above 5% may deter serious market creators. 10% is a hard cap to prevent
/// admin abuse even under compromise scenarios.
///
/// Environment notes:
///   - Development: 2% (relaxed for testing)
///   - Testnet: 2% (mirrors production)
///   - Mainnet: 3% (higher for sustainability with real value)
///
/// Basis Points: Fee percentages are stored and calculated in basis points (1/100th of 1%)
/// where 100 basis points = 1%. This provides precise control over small percentages.

/// basic oracle setup and storage costs without being prohibitive.
///
/// Safe range: 0.1-10 XLM. Lower bounds (0.1 XLM) still deter simple spam

/// # Environment Characteristics
///
/// Each environment is optimized for different use cases:
/// - **Development**: Relaxed rules for testing and development
/// - **Testnet**: Production-like environment for integration testing
/// - **Mainnet**: Full production environment with strict security
/// - **Custom**: Flexible environment for specialized deployments
///
/// # Usage in Configuration
///
/// The environment setting affects:
/// - Fee structures and minimum stakes
/// - Validation thresholds and limits
/// - Oracle timeout and retry settings
/// - Market duration and extension rules
/// - Security and permission requirements
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # use predictify_hybrid::config::Environment;
///
/// // Environment comparison and selection
/// let current_env = Environment::Mainnet;
///

/// Centralized configuration management for the Predictify Hybrid contract.
///
/// The `ConfigManager` provides a comprehensive suite of functions for creating,
/// managing, and maintaining contract configurations across different environments.
/// It serves as the single source of truth for all configuration-related operations.
///
/// # Core Responsibilities
///
/// ConfigManager handles:
/// - **Environment-Specific Configs**: Development, testnet, and mainnet configurations
/// - **Component Configs**: Individual subsystem configuration generation
/// - **Storage Management**: Persistent configuration storage and retrieval
/// - **Validation**: Configuration consistency and validity checks
/// - **Updates**: Safe configuration updates and migrations
///
/// # Configuration Philosophy
///
/// The configuration system follows these principles:
/// - **Environment Appropriate**: Each environment has optimized settings
/// - **Modular Design**: Configurations are composed of focused components
/// - **Safety First**: Validation prevents invalid or dangerous configurations
/// - **Flexibility**: Support for custom configurations when needed
/// - **Maintainability**: Clear, documented, and testable configuration logic
///
/// # Usage Patterns
///
/// ConfigManager is typically used during:
/// - Contract initialization and deployment
/// - Runtime configuration retrieval
/// - Administrative configuration updates
/// - Testing and development setup
/// - Environment migrations
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # use soroban_sdk::Env;
/// # use predictify_hybrid::config::{ConfigManager, Environment};
/// # let env = Env::default();

/// let dev_config = ConfigManager::get_development_config(&env);
/// let mainnet_config = ConfigManager::get_mainnet_config(&env);

/// // Store configuration in contract
/// ConfigManager::store_config(&env, &mainnet_config).unwrap();

/// // Retrieve stored configuration
/// let stored_config = ConfigManager::get_config(&env).unwrap();
/// assert_eq!(stored_config.network.environment, Environment::Mainnet);
