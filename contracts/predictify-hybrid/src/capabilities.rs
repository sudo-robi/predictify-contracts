//! Contract capability discovery via a u64 bitmap.
//!
//! Each publicly-advertised contract feature occupies one bit in a 64-bit
//! integer. Clients can discover which features are safe to call without
//! inspecting the Wasm or relying on version-number heuristics.
//!
//! # Usage
//!
//! ```text
//! let caps = client.capabilities();
//! if caps & capability::VERSIONING != 0 {
//!     // versioning is supported
//! }
//! ```
