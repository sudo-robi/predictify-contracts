/// Resolution management system for Predictify Hybrid contract
///
/// This module provides a comprehensive resolution system with:
/// - Oracle resolution functions and utilities
/// - Market resolution logic and validation
/// - Resolution analytics and statistics
/// - Resolution helper utilities and testing functions
/// - Resolution state management and tracking

// ===== RESOLUTION TYPES =====

/// Enumeration of possible resolution states for market lifecycle management.
///
/// This enum tracks the progression of a market through its resolution phases,
/// from initial creation through final outcome determination. Each state represents
/// a specific stage in the resolution process with distinct validation rules and
/// available operations.
///
/// # State Transitions
///
/// The typical resolution flow follows this pattern:
/// ```text
/// Active → OracleResolved → MarketResolved → [Disputed] → Finalized
/// ```
///
/// **Alternative flows:**
/// - Direct admin resolution: `Active → MarketResolved → Finalized`
/// - Dispute flow: `MarketResolved → Disputed → Finalized`
/// - Oracle-only flow: `Active → OracleResolved → MarketResolved → Finalized`
///
/// # Example Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// # use soroban_sdk::{Env, Symbol};
/// # use predictify_hybrid::resolution::{ResolutionState, ResolutionUtils};
/// # use predictify_hybrid::markets::Market;
/// # let env = Env::default();
/// # let market = Market::default(); // Placeholder
///
/// // Check current resolution state
/// let current_state = ResolutionUtils::get_resolution_state(&env, &market);
///
/// match current_state {
///     ResolutionState::Active => {
///         println!("Market is active, ready for oracle resolution");
///         // Can fetch oracle results
///     },
///     ResolutionState::OracleResolved => {
///         println!("Oracle result available, can proceed to market resolution");
///         // Can combine with community consensus
///     },
///     ResolutionState::MarketResolved => {
///         println!("Market resolved, awaiting finalization or disputes");
///         // Can be disputed or finalized
///     },
///     ResolutionState::Disputed => {
///         println!("Resolution is under dispute");
///         // Dispute resolution process active
///     },
///     ResolutionState::Finalized => {
///         println!("Resolution is final and immutable");
///         // No further changes allowed
///     },
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # State Validation
///
/// Each state has specific validation requirements:
/// - **Active**: Market must be within voting period
/// - **OracleResolved**: Oracle data must be valid and recent
/// - **MarketResolved**: Final outcome must be determined
/// - **Disputed**: Dispute must be properly filed and active
/// - **Finalized**: Resolution must be complete and immutable
///
/// # Business Rules
///
/// State transitions enforce business logic:
/// - Markets cannot skip resolution states arbitrarily
/// - Finalized resolutions cannot be changed
/// - Disputed resolutions require proper dispute resolution
/// - Oracle resolution requires valid oracle data
///
/// # Integration Points
///
/// Resolution states integrate with:
/// - **Market Management**: Controls available market operations
/// - **Voting System**: Determines when voting periods end
/// - **Dispute System**: Manages dispute lifecycle
/// - **Oracle System**: Coordinates oracle data fetching
/// - **Admin Functions**: Enables administrative overrides

///
/// This structure captures the complete oracle response for a market, including

/// # Core Components
///
/// **Market Context:**
/// - **Market ID**: Unique identifier linking resolution to specific market
/// - **Timestamp**: When the oracle resolution was performed
/// - **Provider**: Which oracle service provided the data
///
/// **Oracle Data:**
/// - **Price**: Current asset price from oracle feed
/// - **Threshold**: Market-defined price threshold for comparison
/// - **Comparison**: Comparison operator ("gt", "lt", "eq")
/// - **Feed ID**: Specific oracle feed identifier used

/// println!("Oracle confidence: {}%", confidence);
/// # Ok::<(), predictify_hybrid::errors::Error>(())

///
/// # Price Comparison Logic
///
/// The oracle resolution evaluates market conditions:
/// ```rust
/// # use soroban_sdk::{Env, String};
/// # use predictify_hybrid::oracles::OracleUtils;
/// # let env = Env::default();
///
/// // Example: BTC above $50,000?
/// let btc_price = 52_000_00;    // $52,000 (8 decimal precision)
/// let threshold = 50_000_00;    // $50,000
/// let comparison = String::from_str(&env, "gt"); // Greater than
///
/// let outcome = OracleUtils::determine_outcome(
///     btc_price,
///     threshold,
///     &comparison,
///     &env
/// )?;
///
/// assert_eq!(outcome, String::from_str(&env, "yes")); // BTC > $50k = "yes"
/// # Ok::<(), predictify_hybrid::errors::Error>(())
/// ```
///
/// # Validation Requirements
///
/// Oracle resolutions must meet criteria:
/// - **Valid Price**: Price must be positive and within reasonable bounds
/// - **Recent Data**: Timestamp must be within acceptable staleness limits
/// - **Supported Provider**: Oracle provider must be supported on current network
/// - **Valid Feed**: Feed ID must exist and be active
/// - **Proper Comparison**: Comparison operator must be supported
///
/// # Integration with Market Resolution
///
/// Oracle resolutions feed into broader market resolution:
/// - **Hybrid Resolution**: Combined with community consensus
/// - **Oracle-Only**: Used directly as final outcome
/// - **Dispute Input**: Provides data for dispute resolution
/// - **Confidence Scoring**: Contributes to overall resolution confidence
///
/// # Audit and Transparency
///
/// All oracle resolution data is preserved for:
/// - **Audit Trails**: Complete record of resolution process
/// - **Dispute Evidence**: Data available for dispute proceedings
/// - **Analytics**: Historical analysis of oracle performance

///     _ => println!("Very low confidence - may need review"),
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Resolution Validation
///
/// Market resolutions undergo validation to ensure:
/// - **Outcome Consistency**: Oracle and community data alignment
/// - **Method Appropriateness**: Resolution method suitable for market type
/// - **Data Quality**: All input data meets quality standards
/// - **Timestamp Validity**: Resolution timing is appropriate
/// - **Confidence Thresholds**: Confidence score meets minimum requirements
///
/// # Integration Points
///
/// Market resolutions integrate with:

/// - **Analytics**: Contributes to platform performance metrics
/// - **Audit System**: Provides complete resolution audit trails
/// - **Event System**: Triggers resolution events for transparency
///
/// # Immutability and Finalization
///
/// Once finalized, market resolutions are immutable except through:
/// - **Dispute Process**: Formal dispute resolution procedures
/// - **Admin Override**: Emergency administrative corrections
/// - **System Upgrades**: Protocol-level corrections (rare)

    ///    basis-point weight:

    ///    weight_bps = price × 10 000 / (price + confidence)
    ///    ```

    /// 4. **Baseline median** – Compute the unweighted simple median of the
    ///    successfully fetched prices (used *only* for outlier detection).
    ///
    /// 5. **Outlier filter** – Discard any quote where

// ===== MARKET RESOLUTION =====

/// Comprehensive market resolution management system combining multiple data sources.
///
/// The Market Resolution Manager orchestrates the complete market resolution process,
/// integrating oracle data, community consensus, admin decisions, and dispute outcomes
/// to determine final market results. It serves as the central coordinator for all
/// resolution methods and ensures consistent, reliable market outcomes.
///
/// # Core Responsibilities
///
/// **Resolution Orchestration:**
/// - **Multi-Source Integration**: Combine oracle, community, and admin data
/// - **Method Selection**: Choose appropriate resolution method based on available data
/// - **Confidence Calculation**: Determine overall confidence in resolution outcome
/// - **Validation**: Ensure resolution meets quality and consistency standards
///
/// **Market Lifecycle Management:**
/// - **Resolution Triggering**: Initiate resolution when markets are ready
/// - **State Management**: Track resolution progress through various states
/// - **Finalization**: Complete resolution process and make outcomes immutable
/// - **Event Emission**: Notify system components of resolution events
///
/// # Resolution Methods Supported
///
/// **Hybrid Resolution (Recommended):**
/// - Combines oracle price data with community voting
/// - Highest confidence when sources agree
/// - Fallback logic when sources disagree
///
/// **Oracle-Only Resolution:**
/// - Pure algorithmic resolution based on price feeds
/// - Fast and objective for clear-cut price-based markets
/// - Used when community participation is insufficient
///
/// **Community-Only Resolution:**
/// - Based entirely on community voting consensus
/// - Used when oracle data is unavailable or inappropriate
/// - Requires sufficient participation and consensus
///
/// **Admin Override:**
/// - Administrative decision for exceptional circumstances
/// - Used for emergency situations or system failures
/// - Requires proper admin authentication and justification
///
/// # Example Usage
///
/// ```rust
/// # use soroban_sdk::{Env, Symbol, Address, String};
/// # use predictify_hybrid::resolution::{MarketResolutionManager, MarketResolution, ResolutionMethod};
/// # let env = Env::default();
/// # let market_id = Symbol::new(&env, "btc_prediction_market");
/// # let admin = Address::generate(&env);
///
/// // Resolve a market using hybrid method (oracle + community)
/// let resolution = MarketResolutionManager::resolve_market(&env, &market_id)?;
///
/// println!("Market Resolution Complete:");
/// println!("Market: {}", resolution.market_id);
/// println!("Final outcome: {}", resolution.final_outcome);
/// println!("Method: {:?}", resolution.resolution_method);
/// println!("Confidence: {}%", resolution.confidence_score);
///
/// // Display resolution details
/// match resolution.resolution_method {
///     ResolutionMethod::Hybrid => {
///         println!("Oracle result: {}", resolution.oracle_result);
///         println!("Community consensus: {}% ({})",
///             resolution.community_consensus.percentage,
///             resolution.community_consensus.outcome
///         );
///     },
///     ResolutionMethod::OracleOnly => {
///         println!("Resolved purely based on oracle: {}", resolution.oracle_result);
///     },
///     ResolutionMethod::AdminOverride => {
///         println!("Administrative override resolution");
///     },
///     _ => println!("Other resolution method used"),
/// }
///
/// // Validate the resolution
/// MarketResolutionManager::validate_market_resolution(&env, &resolution)?;
///
/// // Admin can finalize with override if needed
/// if resolution.confidence_score < 70 {
///     let admin_resolution = MarketResolutionManager::finalize_market(
///         &env,
///         &admin,
///         &market_id,
///         &String::from_str(&env, "yes")
///     )?;
///     println!("Admin finalized with outcome: {}", admin_resolution.final_outcome);
/// }
/// # Ok::<(), predictify_hybrid::errors::Error>(())
/// ```
///
/// # Resolution Decision Logic
///
/// The manager uses sophisticated logic to determine final outcomes:
/// ```rust
/// # use soroban_sdk::{Env, String};
/// # use predictify_hybrid::resolution::ResolutionMethod;
/// # use predictify_hybrid::markets::CommunityConsensus;
/// # let env = Env::default();
///
/// // Example resolution decision logic
/// fn determine_final_outcome(
///     oracle_result: &String,
///     community_consensus: &CommunityConsensus,
///     oracle_confidence: u32,
///     community_confidence: u32
/// ) -> (String, ResolutionMethod) {
///     let env = Env::default();
///
///     // Check if oracle and community agree
///     if oracle_result == &community_consensus.outcome {
///         // Agreement - use hybrid method with high confidence
///         (oracle_result.clone(), ResolutionMethod::Hybrid)
///     } else if oracle_confidence > 85 && community_confidence < 60 {
///         // Strong oracle, weak community - use oracle
///         (oracle_result.clone(), ResolutionMethod::OracleOnly)
///     } else if community_confidence > 85 && oracle_confidence < 60 {
///         // Strong community, weak oracle - use community
///         (community_consensus.outcome.clone(), ResolutionMethod::CommunityOnly)
///     } else {
///         // Conflict requires admin intervention
///         (String::from_str(&env, "disputed"), ResolutionMethod::AdminOverride)
///     }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Confidence Scoring
///
/// Resolution confidence is calculated from multiple factors:
/// - **Oracle Confidence**: Quality and freshness of oracle data
/// - **Community Confidence**: Participation level and consensus strength
/// - **Method Reliability**: Inherent reliability of chosen resolution method
/// - **Data Consistency**: Agreement between different data sources
///
/// ```rust
/// # use predictify_hybrid::resolution::MarketResolution;
/// # let resolution = MarketResolution::default(); // Placeholder
///
/// // Interpret confidence levels
/// match resolution.confidence_score {
///     95..=100 => println!("Extremely high confidence - virtually certain outcome"),
///     85..=94 => println!("Very high confidence - strong evidence for outcome"),
///     75..=84 => println!("High confidence - good evidence for outcome"),
///     65..=74 => println!("Moderate confidence - reasonable evidence"),
///     50..=64 => println!("Low confidence - weak evidence, consider review"),
///     _ => println!("Very low confidence - outcome uncertain, needs attention"),
/// }
/// ```
///
/// # Error Handling and Fallbacks
///
/// The manager handles various failure scenarios:
/// - **Oracle Failures**: Fallback to community-only resolution
/// - **Low Participation**: Fallback to oracle-only or admin resolution
/// - **Data Conflicts**: Escalate to dispute resolution process
/// - **System Errors**: Graceful degradation with error reporting
///
/// # Integration with Other Systems
///
/// Market Resolution Manager integrates with:
/// - **Oracle System**: Fetches and validates oracle data
/// - **Voting System**: Retrieves community consensus data
/// - **Dispute System**: Handles disputed resolutions
/// - **Admin System**: Processes administrative overrides
/// - **Event System**: Emits resolution events for transparency
/// - **Analytics System**: Records resolution metrics and performance
///
/// # Performance and Scalability
///
/// The manager optimizes for:
/// - **Batch Processing**: Resolve multiple markets efficiently
/// - **Parallel Resolution**: Handle independent resolutions concurrently
/// - **Caching**: Cache resolution data to avoid redundant calculations
/// - **Event-Driven**: React to market state changes automatically
