// ===== DISPUTE STRUCTURES =====

/// Represents a formal dispute against a market's oracle resolution.
///
/// A dispute is created when a community member challenges the oracle's
/// resolution of a market, believing the outcome is incorrect. Disputes
/// require a stake to prevent spam and ensure serious commitment.
///
/// # Fields
///
/// * `user` - Address of the user who initiated the dispute
/// * `market_id` - Unique identifier of the disputed market
/// * `stake` - Amount staked by the disputer (must meet minimum requirements)
/// * `timestamp` - When the dispute was created (ledger timestamp)
/// * `reason` - Optional explanation for why the dispute was raised
/// * `status` - Current status of the dispute (Active, Resolved, etc.)
///
/// # Example
///
/// ```rust
/// # use soroban_sdk::{Env, Address, Symbol, String};
/// # use predictify_hybrid::disputes::{Dispute, DisputeStatus};
/// # let env = Env::default();

/// # Dispute Lifecycle
///
/// 1. **Creation**: User stakes tokens and provides reasoning
/// 2. **Community Voting**: Other users vote on dispute validity
/// 3. **Resolution**: Dispute is resolved based on community consensus
/// 4. **Fee Distribution**: Stakes are distributed to winning side
